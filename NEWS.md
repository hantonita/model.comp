# model.comp 0.1.0

The first version of `model.comp` is now available. Functionality is extremely limited at this point. The main features are:
  - the `compare_models()` function used to fit and compare specified models on a given dataset
  - currently only the `logreg` (logistic regression) model is supported
  - currently only returns the predicted values calculated with the fitted model on the given dataset
